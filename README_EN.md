# Audio Transcription

This is a Python script that extracts audio from a video or audio file and transcribes the spoken content using the [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model from OpenAI. The script generates a text file with the transcription result.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have installed:

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (used for media manipulation)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

## Installation

### 1. Install Whisper and other dependencies:
You can install Whisper and PyTorch directly via pip, and you will also need to install `ffmpeg` on your system. Run the following commands:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
pip install torch
```

### 2. Install `ffmpeg`:
If you're using macOS, you can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

For other operating systems, follow the installation instructions on the official [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) site.

### 3. Clone the project

If you're using this script in a repository, clone the project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <directory-name>
```

## Usage

1. Place the audio or video file you want to transcribe in the `videoExtract/` folder.

2. Update the file path in the script (`audio_path`) to match the name of your audio/video file.

3. Run the script to start the transcription:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will load the Whisper model, transcribe the audio, and save the transcription in a text file located in the `textExtract/transcricao.txt` directory.

### Path Example

In the provided script, the path to the audio file is specified as follows:

```python
audio_path = "videoExtract/file_name.xx"
```

Update this path to the audio or video file you want to transcribe.

## Output

The audio transcription will be saved in the `textExtract/transcricao.txt` file.

The format of the file will be similar to the following:

```
This is an example of transcription generated by the Whisper model.
